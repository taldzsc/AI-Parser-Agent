# AI-Parser-Agent
This program is a small AI Parser Agent that aims to help users with a large amount of company's PDF and can be used in any usecase. The usecase I worked on was the usecase of HSE of TotalEnergies

Make sure to modify the path in the different functions which creates or modify files in the .json or in folders

I couldn't include the complete folder of PDFs containing TotalEnergies's HSE PDFs since it's a private company content. But I added two PDFs that I used to test the early versions of my parser agent :
 - an extract of the Franz Kafka novel called The Metamorphosis named Franz_Kafka.pdf
 - a pdf containing various images with or without text of it such as a Road sign, a Barcode, a landscape and licence plate. The pdf is called Agent_OCR_testPDF.pdf
